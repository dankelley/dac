Please report any bugs, or suggests for improvements, at the [dc development
site](http://github.com/dankelley/dc/issues). If you are good at R programming
and know of a website that provides data that you think might be of general
interest, you may want to try writing some code to contribute to `dc`. The
simplest method would be to clone and generate a git pull request. Please use
one of the existing R files, such as `R/woa`, as a guide, so that your
suggested function will be similar to the existing ones. This project uses
Roxygen documentation, so please continue that pattern.
