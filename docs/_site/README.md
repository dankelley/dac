Oce is an R package for processing oceanographic data, and the ``gh-pages`` git
branch holds the source of its webpage, hosted on github.com and coded using
the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) web system.

To update the site, edit the Markdown files (ending in `.md`), not the related
`.html` files. After any update to any `.md` file, the `.html` files must be
regenerated by running the following command in the shell:
```
jekyll build --trace
```
and then the repository must be pushed to github.
