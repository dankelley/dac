#' @param debug an integer specifying whether debugging information is
#' to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
#' is used by many \code{oce} functions. Generally, setting \code{debug=0}
#' turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
#' be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
#' \code{debug} first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
#' by specifying higher \code{debug} values.
